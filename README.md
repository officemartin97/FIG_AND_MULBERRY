# FIG_AND_MULBERRY
This repo contains the Fig&amp;Mulberry named project.
 
 The project is about my life. It supposed to store timestamps based data about the days of mine which were good or great. It is mainly for my own entertainment and self reflection. It supposed to motivate me as it shows how many good times I had in my life (from now on) and that it goes against my own dull, selfish and nihilist mindset. "The times that they are a changing"
